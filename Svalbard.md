# Svalbard
## May 2019, 78 degrees North on Spitsbergen island

Svalbard is the northernmost permanent settlement. It's also the warmest place in the World at that latitude,
due to Gulf Stream. North Pole is about 1000 km away.

According to Svalbard Treaty, it is managed by Norway, but any citizen of the World can come to live there if they can
support themselves. Also, countries, which mine for coal, can maintain permanent settlements. There were many of them in the 
past, but currently there are only Norwegians and Russians who still operate there. Longyearbyen, the Norwegian capital,
hosts people from around the world. Barentsburg, Russian settlement, is still mostly a mining town with many East-Ukrainian
miners working there.

Mines are no longer relevant, but have to be operated until the threaty is changed. Currently, polar research and tourism are
main industries.

I have a passion for Northern wilderness, so Svalbard seemed like a perfect spot to get our of mobile coverage and confront
wild nature and polar bears. It is suprisingly easy to get to Longyearbyean - both Norwegian Air and SAS have daily flights from Oslo.
Navigation around is another story - there are no roads and water transport is ridicuosly expensive.

May is "between the seasons" there, meaning that boats may not have started operating yet and you may not use snowmobiles anymore,
because the snow is melting. We were lucky to get to use both.

Snowmobiles are by far the most exciting way to see around. Normally, you cannot leave settlements without a gun due to
polar bears, but in the bar on the first night we learned from locals that polar bears are mostly a threat near water or ice. 
Up the mountains there is a very low probability to crash into them, so we took a flare gun and started riding along GPS tracks
that we were given. Normally, without a guide to make it more exciting and easier to find adventures. The sun does not set in May,
so there was no danger getting stuck in the dark. 

It is a magical experience to ride a snowmobile in the wilderness. You cannot judge distances or sizes of anything you see because
most times there is nothing for reference. Only ocassionally you see white reindeers. There's also plenty of abandoned settlements
and mines to visit that give you a feeling of apocalyptic Ice Age future. The mountains and glaciers and our own thick clothes and
helmets make you feel like you are on another planet. Think Interstellar. And then there's bad snow storms that make everything
around you 100% white and this is when you completely loose your orientation. GPS is a life-saver in this situation.

Getting to **Barentsburg** is quite easy by snowmobiles - we got to abandoned settlement at Colesbukta and from there it's an easy ride.
But we still opted for a Billyfjord ship to get there later because we wanted to stay for several days. In May departures are every other 
day, but there are daily options towards the summer. Barentsburg is less than 100km away, butfeels completely different - 
first you notice seeminly dirty shores due to active coal mining and black smoke from it's power plant.
Lenin statue, people, shop, cantine, sport facilities - all are unmistakably Russian, despite Norwegian Krona being the currency there 
and having Norwegian prices. Barentsburg has the older brewery on the island, but they were out of more interesting beers at that time
because the master brewer was on snowmobile vacation. Barentsburg has also only one tour company, so it's easier to organize and rent
any equipment in Longyearbyen.

I would say that May turned out to be great time to visit because we had midnight sun, but still enough snow to ride on and not
many other tourists. Definitely I'm coming back during the February-March "eternal sunrise" period and probably summer as well when you 
can really see more rocks and fossils, which are under snow most of the year.
