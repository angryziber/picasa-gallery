# Easter Island / Isla de Pascua / Rapa Nui
## November 2019

Easter Island is one of the most remote islands out there, but it is not very hard to get to. There were daily flights
from Santiago de Chile before the Covid pandemic, each flight bringing 150 people to the island with population of a few thousand.

The island itself is a small beautiful green volcanic island in the middle of nowhere.
There are no other land for thousands of kilometers in any direction, so a 5-hour flight there lets you see only the blue ocean.

Thor Heyerdahl helped to popularize the island when he tried to prove the islanders may have come from the South America
by rafts. He showed that it is possible, but he was wrong. The culture of the islanders is very much related to other
Polynesian islands, even similar to Hawaii. 

But the Moai heads are awesome. Unfortunately there were all knocked down by internal conflicts, but Thor and others helped to raise
some of them back to their former glory. And the quarry, where they were built, Rano Raraku, is out of this world - you
can see hundreds of finished and unfinished heads looking at you from different angles and directions. Too bad they don't allow general public to the inside of the crater.

I was a big fan of Thor's books and adventures in the childhood, so visiting the Easter Island someday was a dream.
The longest distance on the island is about 36km, so I rented a small 4x4 car - Suzuki Jimny and could visit and 
revisit most sites many times, wait for a better light, sunrise, sunset, etc. That was definitely a photo trip.

But what happened after was a huge disappointment and killed my motivation to take pictures for a year or so.
I even refused to look at pictures from Chile for quite some time. We were robbed in Valparaiso at the end of Chile
trip, with most of my pictures being on the laptop that was stolen, along with lenses, drone with photos and videos,
and even the passports. Getting back home was tough.

What you see here are some deleted pictures I was able to recover from my memory card and my phone. Not much, but
still something. I really miss some of the ones I lost, but the sadness is going away slowly. Enjoy what is left!
